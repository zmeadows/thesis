A search for heavy resonances decaying to a $W$ or $Z$ boson and a Higgs boson in the final state is described.
The search uses \lumi\ of proton-proton collision data at \sqrts collected by the ATLAS detector at the CERN Large Hadron Collider from 2015 to 2018.
The results are presented in terms of constraints on a simplified model with a heavy vector triplet.
Upper limits are set on the production cross-section times branching fraction for resonances decaying into a W/Z boson and a Higgs boson in the mass range between 1.2 to 5 TeV.

A search for resonances decaying to a W or Z boson and a Higgs boson has been carried out in the all-hadronic $q\bar{q}^{(\prime)}b\bar{b}$ channel with \lumi~ of $pp$ collision data collected by ATLAS during 2015-2018 runs of the LHC at $\sqrt{s} = 13$~TeV.
Both the vector boson and Higgs boson candidates are reconstructed using large radius jets, and small radius b-tagged track jets are exploited to tag the Higgs boson candidate jet.
The background consists mainly of multijet, \tt, and $V$+jets events, and is modelled using a data driven method with BDT re-weighting.

No significant excess of events is observed over the expected background and the upper limits set on the crosssection for $pp \rightarrow W^\prime \rightarrow WH$ and $pp \rightarrow Z^\prime \rightarrow ZH$ range from 6.8 fb at $m$(W$^\prime$) = 1.5 TeV to 0.53 fb at $m$(W$^\prime$) = 5.0 TeV, and from 8.7 fb at $m$(Z$^\prime$) = 1.5 TeV to 0.53 fb at $m$(Z$^\prime$) = 5.0 TeV, at 95\% CL. These results translate into lower limits on the mass of W$^\prime$ (Z$^\prime$) bosons of 2.90 TeV (2.20 TeV) in the context of the weakly coupled HVT model A and of 3.20 TeV (2.65 TeV) in the context of the strongly coupled HVT model B, at 95\% CL.

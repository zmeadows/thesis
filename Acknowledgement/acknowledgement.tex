It is truly impossible to accomplish any sufficiently large project on your own. Especially in a large collaboration such as ATLAS, support comes from many different directions and becomes a famiilar aspect of daily research life. There is no way I could list all those who have helped me along the way, so here I will single out only a few.

Firstly I would like to thank my advisor Stephane Willocq for the hundreds of discussions and pieces of sage advice, concerning physics or otherwise, which kept all the pieces of this research together and always moving forward. On top of this I credit him with an uncommon level of patience for gracefully tolerating my more stubborn moments as we encountered forks in the road.

Additionally I would like to thank the brilliant post-doctoral researchers I was fortunate enough to work closely with: Attilio Picazio, InÃªs Ochoa, and Nora Pettersson. Without their in-depth knowledge, fortitude, and willingness to share their time I might still be sitting at my desk wondering whose brilliant decision it was to admit me into an actual physics program.

Lastly I would like to thank my partner, Alissa, for absolutely everything.

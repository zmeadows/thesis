\chapter{Results}
\label{ch:results}
In this section the results of the combined fit with the full 2015, 2016, 2017, and 2018 datasets will be presented, corresponding to a total integrated luminosity of \lumi.

\subsection{Post-Fit Dijet Mass}

Post-fit studies performed on various mass points for both WH and ZH final states are used to verify the integrity of the fits.
In all cases, stable results are obtained and only a representative set of studies is shown in this section.
Figure~\ref{fig:post_fit_2p6TeV} shows the resulting post-fit \mvh\ distributions.
The pulls and constraints on the nuisance parameters are shown in Figure ~\ref{fig:pull_plots} for the WH 2.6 TeV and ZH 4.0 TeV mass points.
The ranking of nuisance parameters are shown in Figures~\ref{fig:rank_plots_2p6TeV} and~\ref{fig:rank_plots_4TeV} for 2.6 TeV and 4.0 TeV signal mass points, respectively.

%TODO: In figure captions better explain ranking plot, correlation matrix, etc

\subsection{Local Significance}

The relevance of any excesses observed in data with respect to the background expectation is quantified by estimating the local signifiance ($p_0$) using the asymptotic approximation.
The combined local significance of the 1-tag + 2-tag channels is shown for both WH and ZH samples in Figure~\ref{fig:local_p0_combined}.
The largest deviation is observed in the fit to the WH signal region and corresponds to a $p_0$ value of 0.03 for a resonance mass of 2.8 TeV.

\end{figure}

\subsection{Upper Limits on Cross Section}
Upper limits on the cross section times branching ratio for a resonance decaying to $VH$ are shown in Figure~\ref{fig:exp_limits_atlas}, for both the WH and ZH signal regions.
The expected and observed upper limits are compared to the predicted HVT Models A and B, from which mass exclusion values can be determined.
For Model A, the excluded signal mass ranges are 1500-2900 GeV for $WH$ resonances, and 1500-2200 GeV for $ZH$ resonances.
For Model B, the excluded signal mass ranges are 1500-3200 GeV for $WH$ resonances, and 1500-2650 GeV for $ZH$ resonances.
These results can also be translated into exclusions in the {$g_H,g_f$} plane, where $g_f$ represents a universal coupling between the $V'$ bosons and fermions.
Here, $g_q$ is taken to be equal to $g_f$. Figure ~\ref{fig:hvt_coupling_plane} shows the 95\% CL limits in this plane for several resonance masses.
The expected limits are compared to the previous iteration of the analysis in Figure~\ref{fig:exp_limit_cmp}.
The individual contributions from the separate 1/2-tag channels are shown in Fig ~\ref{fig:exp_limit_channels}.

\subsection{Conclusions}
A search for resonances decaying to a W or Z boson and a Higgs boson has been carried out in the all-hadronic $q\bar{q}^{(\prime)}b\bar{b}$ channel with \lumi~ of $pp$ collision data collected by ATLAS during 2015-2018 runs of the LHC at $\sqrt{s} = 13$~TeV.
Both the vector boson and Higgs boson candidates are reconstructed using large radius jets, and small radius b-tagged track jets are exploited to tag the Higgs boson candidate jet.
The background consists mainly of multijet, \tt, and $V$+jets events, and is modelled using a data driven method with BDT re-weighting.

No significant excess of events is observed over the expected background.
Upper limits on the production cross-section $pp \rightarrow W' \rightarrow WH$ and $pp \rightarrow Z' \rightarrow ZH$ are set for resonance masses in the range between 1.5 and 5.0 TeV.
The corresponding excluded HVT Model B signal mass ranges are 1500-3200 GeV for WH resonances and 1500-2650 for ZH resonances.

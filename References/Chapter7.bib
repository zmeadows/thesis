abstract = {Abstract A minimal remeshing finite element method for crack growth is presented. Discontinuous enrichment functions are added to the finite element approximation to account for the presence of the crack. This method allows the crack to be arbitrarily aligned within the mesh. For severely curved cracks, remeshing may be needed but only away from the crack tip where remeshing is much easier. Results are presented for a wide range of two-dimensional crack problems showing excellent accuracy. Copyright ? 1999 John Wiley {\&} Sons, Ltd.},

Moreover, the assumption typically made for computational purposes that its coefficients remain constant for all possible configurations is incompatible with elasticity. It is further shown that an assumption widely used in the computational literature in the context of finite deformation plasticity, namely, relating an objective stress rate to the rate of deformation tensor through a fourth-rank constant isotropic tensor, is also incompatible with elasticity, thus furnishing an example of an hypoelastic material which is not elastic."

This not only warrants a hyperelastic characterization in the bonding part which remedies problems associated with hypoelastic approaches devising objective stress rates selected on ad hoc basis, see, e.g., Dooling et al. (2001) and Li and Buckley (2009), but also allows a transparent and naturally objective implementation analogous to the geometrically linear theory. A numerical implementation into Abaqus is pursued where algorithms for stress update and tangent moduli computations are reported. It is shown that significant reduction in nonlinear equation system size is possible in the computation of both bonding and conformational part. The characterization tests include constant-width tension, equi-biaxial tension, and simple shear. To demonstrate the robustness of the developed framework, two hypothetical problems of extreme deformation under tensile and combined tensile and torsion loading are considered. Finally, simulation of an injection stretch-blow molding process is presented as an application problem."

If correction for this is made, the isothermal curves of log10 viscosity as a function of soda content are smooth up to 50\% Na2O, showing no inflection. The observations as a function of temperature T are all represented within accidental error by an equation of the type where all three constants vary regularly with the composition. Change of Viscosity of Glass (6SiO2, 2Na2O) due to Molecular Substitution of CaO, MgO and Al2O3 for Na2O The effect is clearly brought out by plotting (from the results of English) the change of log10η due to the substitution as a function of temperature. The curves each show a sharp bend at a temperature between 840° and 1050°C, which is designated the aggregation temperature Ta. If we divide these curves by the corresponding percentage substituted, we get curves for each oxide which are straight and parallel below the aggregation temperatures, the slopes (increase of change of log10η per 100°C) being −0.056 (CaO), −0.055 (MgO), −0.018 (A12O3) per per cent oxide substituted. For substitution of 1/2 molecule the slopes are −0.325 (CaO), −0.23 (MgO) and −0.18 (Al2O3) per 100°. At the aggregation temperature the change of log10η per per cent is a minimum, 0.03 to 0.06 for CaO, 0.12 for MgO, 0.07 for Al2O3. Evidence of Aggregation in Glasses, from viscosity Measurements The sharp bends in the plots of change of log10η due to substitution of an oxide for Na2O, suggest the beginning of molecular aggregation at these temperatures. These aggregation temperatures are close to the devitrification temperatures, but the effect on the viscosity curves cannot be due to actual devitrification since it does not change with time. Taking the aggregation temperatures as equal to devitrification temperatures, additional isotherms are roughly sketched into the equilibrium triangle of the system Na2O-CaO-SiO2. Change of Viscosity of Glass (4SiO2, 2Na2O) due to of Substitution of B2O3 for SiO2 The change of log10η (from the results of English) is plotted as a function of temperature, and also the change of log10η per per cent B2O3. The curves are more complex than for the substitution for Na2O.},

	abstract = {Abstract A stabilized conforming (SC) nodal integration, which meets the integration constraint in the Galerkin mesh-free approximation, is generalized for non-linear problems. Using a Lagrangian discretization, the integration constraints for SC nodal integration are imposed in the undeformed configuration. This is accomplished by introducing a Lagrangian strain smoothing to the deformation gradient, and by performing a nodal integration in the undeformed configuration. The proposed method is independent to the path dependency of the materials. An assumed strain method is employed to formulate the discrete equilibrium equations, and the smoothed deformation gradient serves as the stabilization mechanism in the nodally integrated variational equation. Eigenvalue analysis demonstrated that the proposed strain smoothing provides a stabilization to the nodally integrated discrete equations. By employing Lagrangian shape functions, the computation of smoothed gradient matrix for deformation gradient is only necessary in the initial stage, and it can be stored and reused in the subsequent load steps. A significant gain in computational efficiency is achieved, as well as enhanced accuracy, in comparison with the mesh-free solution using Gauss integration. The performance of the proposed method is shown to be quite robust in dealing with non-uniform discretization. Copyright ? 2002 John Wiley {\&} Sons, Ltd.},

Existence of a solution in RKPM discretized hyperelasticity problem is discussed. A Lagrange multiplier method and a direct transformation method are presented to impose essential boundary conditions. The characteristics of material and spatial kernel functions are discussed. In the present work, the use of a material kernel function assures reproducing kernel stability under large deformation. Several of numerical examples are presented to study the characteristics of RKPM shape functions and to demonstrate the effectiveness of this method in large deformation analysis. Since the current approach employs                                    global shape functions, the method demonstrates a superior performance to the conventional finite element methods in dealing with large material distortions.},

In this work, two boundary condition treatments are proposed to enhance the computational efficiency of meshfree methods for contact problems. The mixed transformation method is modified from the previous full transformation method by introducing a node partitioning and a mixed coordinate so that the matrix inversion and multiplication of coordinate transformation involves operations only on the sub-degrees of freedom associated with the boundary group. The boundary singular kernel method introduces singularities to the kernel functions of the essential and contact boundary nodes so that the corresponding coefficients of the singular kernel shape functions recover nodal values, and consequently kinematic constraints can be imposed directly.

All integrals can be easily evaluated over regularly shaped domains (in general, spheres in three-dimensional problems) and their boundaries. No post-smoothing technique is required for computing the derivatives of the unknown variable, since the original solution, using the moving least squares approximation, is already smooth enough. Several numerical examples are presented in the paper. In the example problems dealing with Laplace {\&} Poisson's equations, high rates of convergence with mesh refinement for the Sobolev norms ||{\textperiodcentered}||0 and ||{\textperiodcentered}||1 have been found, and the values of the unknown variable and its derivatives are quite accurate.

@article{Chen1996,
abstract = {Large deformation analysis of non-linear elastic and inelastic structures based on Reproducing Kernel Particle Methods (RKPM) is presented. The method requires no explicit mesh in computation and therefore avoids mesh distortion difficulties in large deformation analysis. The current formulation considers hyperelastic and elasto-plastic materials since they represent path-independent and path-dependent material behaviors, respectively. In this paper, a material kernel function and an RKPM material shape function are introduced for large deformation analysis. The support of the RKPM material shape function covers the same set of particles during material deformation and hence no tension instability is encountered in the large deformation computation. The essential boundary conditions are introduced by the use of a transformation method. The transformation matrix is formed only once at the initial stage if the RKPM material shape functions are employed. The appropriate integration procedures for the moment matrix and its derivative are studied from the standpoint of reproducing conditions. In transient problems with an explicit time integration method, the lumped mass matrices are constructed at nodal coordinate so that masses are lumped at the particles. Several hyperelasticity and elasto-plasticity problems are studied to demonstrate the effectiveness of the method. The numerical results indicated that RKPM handles large material distortion more effectively than finite elements due to its smoother shape functions and, consequently, provides a higher solution accuracy under large deformation. Unlike the conventional finite element approach, the nodal spacing irregularity in RKPM does not lead to irregular mesh shape that significantly deteriorates solution accuracy. No volumetric locking is observed when applying non-linear RKPM to nearly incompressible hyperelasticity and perfect plasticity problems. Further, model adaptivity in RKPM can be accomplished simply by adding more points in the highly deformed areas without remeshing.},

The character of the shape functions in meshfree methods is reviewed and compared to those used in the Finite Element Method (FEM). Emphasis is placed on the relationship between the supports of the shape functions and the subdomains used to integrate the discrete equations. The construction of quadrature cells without regard to the local supports of the shape functions is shown to result in the possibility of considerable integration error. Numerical studies using the meshfree Element Free Galerkin (EFG) method illustrate the effect of these errors on solutions to elliptic problems. A construct for integration cells which reduces quadrature error is presented. The observations and conclusions apply to all Galerkin methods which use meshfree approximations.},

Therefore, a better understanding of the interdependence between the machine parameters set up by the operators, process parameters or material behaviour under the initial conditions and the bottle final thickness distribution in an industrial setting is mandatory. Comprehensive measurements of various parameters on an industrial machine allowed a more complete assessment of the process. In addition, the temperature of the pre-form was measured on both inside and outside surfaces which revealed significant difference. Particular care was given to the understanding of the air flow during blowing. In this sense a simple thermodynamic model is proposed and implemented in an ISBM simulation. The followed indicators were the kinematics of the bubble expansion and pressure and force histories. {\textcopyright} 2010 Springer-Verlag France.},

abstract = {{\textcopyright} 2016 The Author(s)This paper highlights for the first time a full comprehension of the deformation procedure during the injection stretch blow moulding (ISBM) process of poly(ethylene terephthalate) (PET) containers, namely thin-walled rigid bottles. The processes required to form PET bottles are complicated and extensive; any development in understanding the nature of material deformation can potentially improve the bottle optimisation process. Removing the bottle mould and performing free-stretch-blow (FSB) experiments revealed insight into the bottle forming characteristics at various preform temperatures and blowing rates. Process outputs cavity pressure and stretch-rod force were recorded using at instrumented stretch-rod and preform surface strain mapping was determined using a combination of a unique patterning procedure and high speed stereoscopic digital image correlation. The unprecedented experimental analysis reveals that the deformation behaviour varies considerably with contrasting process input parameters. Investigation into the effect on deformation mode, strain rate and final bottle shape provide a basis for full understanding of the process optimisation and therefore how the process inputs may aid development of the preferred optimised container.},

abstract = {Domain integration by Gauss quadrature in the Galerkin mesh-free methods adds considerable complexity to solution procedures. Direct nodal integration, on the other hand, leads to a numerical instability due to under integration and vanishing derivatives of shape functions at the nodes. A strain smoothing stabilization for nodal integration is proposed to eliminate spatial instability in nodal integration. For convergence, an integration constraint (IC) is introduced as a necessary condition for a linear exactness in the mesh-free Galerkin approximation. The gradient matrix of strain smoothing is shown to satisfy IC using a divergence theorem. No numerical control parameter is involved in the proposed strain smoothing stabilization. The numerical results show that the accuracy and convergent rates in the mesh-free method with a direct nodal integration are improved considerably by the proposed stabilized conforming nodal integration method. It is also demonstrated that the Gauss integration method fails to meet IC in mesh-free discretization. For this reason the proposed method provides even better accuracy than Gauss integration for Galerkin mesh-free method as presented in several numerical examples.

Introducing and demonstrating the utility of computational tools and simulations, Mechanics of Solid Polymers provides a modern view of how solid polymers behave, how they can be experimentally characterized, and how to predict their behavior in different load environments. Reflecting the significant progress made in the understanding of polymer behaviour over the last two decades, this book will discuss recent developments and compare them to classical theories. The book shows how best to make use of commercially available finite element software to solve polymer mechanics problems, introducing readers to the current state of the art in predicting failure using a combination of experiment and computational techniques. Case studies and example Matlab code are also included. As industry and academia are increasingly reliant on advanced computational mechanics software to implement sophisticated constitutive models – and authoritative information is hard to find in one place - this book provides engineers with what they need to know to make best use of the technology available.

abstract = {In this paper we present a new technique of enforcing Essential Boundary Conditions (EBC) in Meshless Methods (MMs) based on the Element Free Galerkin (EFG) principles. Imposing EBC is a fundamental issue in MMs. The imposition of prescribed displacement values on the boundary in MMs based on approximating shape functions is not as straightforward as in the Finite Element Method (FEM) because the meshless shape functions are generally not interpolating at nodes. Furthermore, many techniques of enforcing EBC are not compatible with explicit time integration schemes. This paper describes a new method of imposing EBC in EFG based MMs suitable for explicit time integration, named Essential Boundary Conditions Imposition in Explicit Meshless (EBCIEM). The effectiveness of the proposed method is demonstrated using both 2D and 3D numerical examples.},

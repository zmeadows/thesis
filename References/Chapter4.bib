abstract = {A general formulation for developing reproducing kernel (RK) interpolation is presented. This is based on the coupling of a primitive function and an enrichment function. The primitive function introduces discrete Kronecker delta properties, while the enrichment function constitutes reproducing conditions. A necessary condition for obtaining a RK interpolation function is an orthogonality condition between the vector of enrichment functions and the vector of shifted monomial functions at the discrete points. A normalized kernel function with relative small support is employed as the primitive function. This approach does not employ a finite element shape function and therefore the interpolation function can be arbitrarily smooth. To maintain the convergence properties of the original RK approximation, a mixed interpolation is introduced. A rigorous error analysis is provided for the proposed method. Optimal order error estimates are shown for the meshfree interpolation in any Sobolev norms. Optimal order convergence is maintained when the proposed method is employed to solve one-dimensional boundary value problems. Numerical experiments are done demonstrating the theoretical error estimates. The performance of the method is illustrated in several sample problems. Copyright © 2003 John Wiley \& Sons, Ltd.},

	abstract = {SUMMARY Calculations on general point-set surfaces are attractive because of their flexibility and simplicity in the preprocessing but present important challenges. The absence of a mesh makes it nontrivial to decide if two neighboring points in the three-dimensional embedding are nearby or rather far apart on the manifold. Furthermore, the topology of surfaces is generally not that of an open two-dimensional set, ruling out global parametrizations. We propose a general and simple numerical method analogous to the mathematical theory of manifolds, in which the point-set surface is described by a set of overlapping charts forming a complete atlas. We proceed in four steps: (1) partitioning of the node set into subregions of trivial topology; (2) automatic detection of the geometric structure of the surface patches by nonlinear dimensionality reduction methods; (3) parametrization of the surface using smooth meshfree (here maximum-entropy) approximants; and (4) gluing together the patch representations by means of a partition of unity. Each patch may be viewed as a meshfree macro-element. We exemplify the generality, flexibility, and accuracy of the proposed approach by numerically approximating the geometrically nonlinear Kirchhoff–Love theory of thin-shells. We analyze standard benchmark tests as well as point-set surfaces of complex geometry and topology. Copyright © 2012 John Wiley \& Sons, Ltd.},

The starting point is to introduce some stabilization terms as a means of circumventing the onerous zero-energy deformation in the Lagrangian particle method. The stabilization terms are derived from the approximate strain vector by the combination of a constant and strain derivatives, which leads to a multiple nodal stress points algorithm for stabilization. The resultant stabilized Lagrangian particle formulation is a non-residual type that renders no artificial control parameters in the stabilization procedure. Subsequently, the stabilized formulation is supplemented by an adaptive anisotropic Lagrangian kernel and a bond-based material failure criterion to sufficiently prevent the tension instability and excessive straining problems. Several numerical examples are presented to examine the effectiveness and accuracy of the proposed method for modeling large strain and material failure in manufacturing processes."

In this method, the crack can be arbitrarily oriented, but its growth is represented discretely by activation of crack surfaces at individual particles, so no representation of the crack's topology is needed. The crack is modelled by a local enrichment of the test and trial functions with a sign function (a variant of the Heaviside step function), so that the discontinuities are along the direction of the crack. The discontinuity consists of cylindrical planes centred at the particles in three dimensions, lines centred at the particles in two dimensions. The model is applied to several 2D problems and compared to experimental data. Copyright © 2004 John Wiley \& Sons, Ltd.},

The method is applicable to general point distributions and leads to positive definite linear systems.

In this paper, we incorporate cell-wise strain smoothing operations into conventional finite elements and propose the smoothed finite element method (SFEM) for 2D elastic problems. It is found that a quadrilateral element divided into four smoothing cells can avoid spurious modes and gives stable results for integration over the element. Compared with original FEM, the SFEM achieves more accurate results and generally higher convergence rate in energy without increasing computational cost. More importantly, as no mapping or coordinate transformation is involved in the SFEM, its element is allowed to be of arbitrary shape. Hence the restriction on the shape bilinear isoparametric elements can be removed and problem domain can be discretized in more flexible ways, as demonstrated in the example problems.",

A series of test examples were numerically analysed using the present method, including 1-D and 2-D partial differential equations, in order to test the accuracy and efficiency of the proposed schemes. Several aspects have been numerically investigated, including the choice of shape parameter c with can greatly affect the accuracy of the approximation; the enforcement of additional polynomial terms; and the application of the Hermite-type interpolation which makes use of the normal gradient on Neumann boundary for the solution of PDEs with Neumann boundary conditions. Particular emphasis was on an efficient scheme, namely Hermite-type interpolation for dealing with Neumann boundary conditions. The numerical results demonstrate that good improvement on accuracy can be obtained after using Hermite-type interpolation. The h-convergence rates are also studied for RPICM with different forms of basis functions and different additional terms."

Whereas the thickness distribution is one of the most important criteria in the production of bottles. So this work focused on the polyethylene terephthalate (PET) preform growth using a transparent mold, through which the instantaneous images of the preform in the stretching and blowing stage were captured. By changing the delay time of the preblow, the three preform growth types, referred to as dolphin, sandpile, and two-bubble, were observed. The longitudinal and hoop stresses acting on the preform segment during the stretching and blowing were analyzed. Two parameters, on which the longitudinal and hoop stresses depend, respectively, were defined. Then combining the geometry and sizes of the preform, the stresses and temperature distribution on it, and the stress–strain curves of the PET material used, the cause for different preform growth types was systematically analyzed. On the basis of preform growth types, the thickness distributions of the bottles obtained under different delay times of the preblow were explained. © 2006 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

Accordingly, polymer chains undergo a stretching process that causes the development of strain-induced crystallites, different crystal morphologies, and the orientation of polymer chains within the amorphous phase. Many process parameters (e.g., draw ratio, draw temperature) and intrinsic properties of the initial material (e.g., molecular weight, molecular weight distribution) determine the effectiveness of this process and the subsequent effect on the final properties of the material, which are closely related to the internal morphology of the polymer. Therefore the mechanical performance, barrier properties, or piezoelectric response, among others, could be optimized via strain-induced morphological changes. This chapter provides a broad overview on the current state of the art regarding the molecular basis, segmental dynamics, and kinetic, morphological, and structural considerations associated with strain-induced crystallization. For some particular applications, strain-induced crystallization has resulted in the development of polymers for advanced industrial applications, which are briefly summarized at the end of the chapter."

Relatively straightforward static and dynamic experimental techniques are employed to determine the six parameters in the constitutive relationship. Comparison of predictions based on the proposed model with experiments shows that it is able to aptly describe visco-hyperelastic behaviour of rubber-like materials under high strain rates. The material model is also used in a simulation of the three-dimensional dynamic response of a rubber pad to impact. Comparison with experimental results shows that there is good agreement with the simulation."

It is scalable in parallel computations, and applicable to a wide variety of problems. Because the moment matrix is computed in constructing meshfree approximation, the algorithm is very suitable for meshfree computations, though it can be used in finite element computations as well. Moreover, such contact-detection algorithm can be conveniently implemented to detect self-contact. Both algorithmic and mathematical aspects of the contact algorithm are discussed in the paper. To validate the proposed contact algorithm, the Taylor bar problem is computed using both meshfree method and finite element method (FEM) to simulate a viscoplastic projectile impacting with a rigid target at high speed. Numerical results obtained with the meshfree contact algorithm show that this new contact algorithm can accurately predict the contact as well as separation of projectile and target. In addition, the numerical results obtained show distinct and detailed shear band formations occurring in the impact event."

    abstract = { It has long been known that metals may be subjected momentarily to stresses for exceeding their static yield stress without suffering plastic strain. One of the simplest methods for subjecting a metal to a high stress for a short time is to form it into a cylindrical specimen and fire this at a steel target. The front part of this projectile crumples up, but the rear part is left undeformed. If the target is rigid the distance which this portion travels while it is being brought to rest may be taken as the difference between the initial length and the length of the deformed specimen after impact. Knowing the velocity of impact, a minimum possible value can be assigned to the maximum acceleration of the material, and from this a minimum value for the yield stress can be calculated. The actual yield stress is considerably greater than this minimum, and methods are given for calculating a more probable value. }

Here the effectiveness of particle discretizations in reproducing of the onset of material instabilities is analyzed in two dimensions. For this purpose, a simplified hyperelastic law and a Blatz--Ko material are used. It is shown that the Eulerian kernels used in smooth particle hydrodynamics severely distort the domain of material stability, so that material instabilities can occur in stress states that should be stable. In particular, for the uniaxial case, material instabilities occur at much lower stresses, which is often called the tensile instability. On the other hand, for Lagrangian kernels, the domain of material stability is reproduced very well. We also show that particle methods without stress points exhibit instabilities due to rank deficiency of the discrete equations.",

abstract = "Some materials may naturally form discontinuities such as cracks as a result of deformation. As an aid to the modeling of such materials, a new framework for the basic equations of continuum mechanics, called the ‘peridynamic’ formulation, is proposed. The propagation of linear stress waves in the new theory is discussed, and wave dispersion relations are derived. Material stability and its connection with wave propagation is investigated. It is demonstrated by an example that the reformulated approach permits the solution of fracture problems using the same equations either on or off the crack surface or crack tip. This is an advantage for modeling problems in which the location of a crack is not known in advance."

Specifically, Smooth-Particle Hydrodynamics (SPH) in the Total Lagrangian formalism is considered. This method is rank-deficient in the sense that the SPH approximation of the deformation gradient is not unique with respect to the positions of the integration points. The non-uniqueness can result in the formation of zero-energy modes. If undetected, these modes can grow and completely dominate the solution. Here, an algorithm is introduced, which effectively suppresses these modes in a fashion similar to hour-glass control mechanisms in Finite-Element methods. Simulations utilizing this control algorithm exhibit much improved stability, accuracy, and error convergence properties. In contrast to an alternative method which eliminates zero-energy modes, namely the use of additional integration points, the here presented algorithm is easy to implement and computationally very efficient."

abstract = {Abstract The paper discusses the problem of tension instability of particle-based methods such as smooth particle hydrodynamics (SPH) or corrected SPH (CSPH). It is shown that tension instability is a property of a continuum where the stress tensor is isotropic and the value of the pressure is a function of the density or volume ratio. The paper will show that, for this material model, the non-linear continuum equations fail to satisfy the stability condition in the presence of tension. Consequently, any discretization of this continuum will result in negative eigenvalues in the tangent stiffness matrix that will lead to instabilities in the time integration process. An important exception is the 1-D case where the continuum becomes stable but SPH or CSPH can still exhibit negative eigenvalues. The paper will show that these negative eigenvalues can be eliminated if a Lagrangian formulation is used whereby all derivatives are referred to a fixed reference configuration. The resulting formulation maintains the momentum preservation properties of its Eulerian equivalent. Finally a simple 1-D wave propagation example will be used to demonstrate that a stable solution can be obtained using Lagrangian CSPH without the need for any artificial viscosity.

Nevertheless, updating the reference configuration may still be necessary in some problems involving extremely large distortions. However, as discussed here, a standard updated formulation suffers the presence of zero-energy modes that are activated and may completely spoil the solution. It is important to note that, unlike an Eulerian formulation, the updated Lagrangian does not present tension instability but only zero-energy modes. Here a stabilization technique is incorporated to the updated formulation to obtain an improved method without any mechanisms and which is capable to solve problems with extremely large distortions.

Since standard "black box" packages may be too inefficient if the number of matrices is large, we study several alternatives. We consider optimized implementations of the Jacobi, QL, and Cuppen algorithms and compare them with an alytical method relying on Cardano's formula for the eigenvalues and on vector cross products for the eigenvectors. Jacobi is the most accurate, but also the slowest method, while QL and Cuppen are good general purpose algorithms. The analytical algorithm outperforms the others by more than a factor of 2, but becomes inaccurate or may even fail completely if the matrix entries differ greatly in magnitude. This can mostly be circumvented by using a hybrid method, which falls back to QL if conditions are such that the analytical calculation might become too inaccurate. For all algorithms, we give an overview of the underlying mathematical ideas, and present detailed benchmark results. C and Fortran implementations of our code are available for download from . }

abstract = {Summary A nonlinear nodal-integrated meshfree Galerkin formulation based on recently proposed strain gradient stabilization (SGS) method is developed for large deformation analysis of elastoplastic solids. The SGS is derived from a decomposed smoothed displacement field and is introduced to the standard variational formulation through the penalty method for the inelastic analysis. The associated strain gradient matrix is assembled by a B-bar method for the volumetric locking control in elastoplastic materials. Each meshfree node contains two coinciding integration points for the integration of weak form by the direct nodal integration scheme. As a result, a nonlinear stabilized nodal integration method with dual nodal stress points is formulated, which is free from stabilization control parameters and integration cells for meshfree computation. In the context of extreme large deformation analysis, an adaptive anisotropic Lagrangian kernel approach is introduced to the nonlinear SGS formulation. The resultant Lagrangian formulation is constantly updated over a period of time on the new reference configuration to maintain the well-defined displacement gradients as well as strain gradients in the Lagrangian computation. Several numerical benchmarks are studied to demonstrate the effectiveness and accuracy of the proposed method in large deformation inelastic analyses. Copyright © 2015 John Wiley \& Sons, Ltd.},

abstract = "Meshfree approximation schemes possess a high potential in computer aided engineering due to their large flexibility. Especially the tremendous progress in processor technology within recent years relativizes the increase in computation time due to the inherent search algorithm. Nevertheless meshfree approximation schemes are still faced with some challenges, like imposition of Dirichlet boundary conditions, robustness of the algorithm and accuracy. The recent developed Optimal Transportation Meshfree (OTM) method seemed to overcome most of these problems. In this paper the OTM solution scheme is combined with a standard search algorithm in order to allow a simple and flexible computation. However this scheme is not stable for some examples of application. Hence an investigation is conducted which shows that the reason for this instability is due to underintegration. Based on this investigation a remedy to stabilize the algorithm is suggested which is based on well known concepts to control the hourglass effects in the Finite Element Method. In contrast to the original publication, the OTM algorithm is derived here from the principle of virtual work. Local maximum entropy shape functions are used which possess a weak Kronecker-δ property. This enables a direct imposition of Dirichlet boundary conditions if the boundary is convex. The limitations of this basis function are also addressed in this paper. Additionally, the search algorithm presented fulfills basic topological requirements. Several examples are investigated demonstrating the improved behavior of the stabilized OTM algorithm."

Note that the different methods and algorithms for the evaluation of the forces depend strongly on the kind of the potential used in the model. We will start in this chapter with the derivation of an algorithm for short-range interactions. This approach exploits the fast decay of a short-range potential function and the associated forces. Thus, short-range interactions can be approximated well if only the geometrically closest neighbors of each particle are considered.

The method is meshless in the sense that deformation is calculated at nodes that are not part of an element mesh. Node placement is almost arbitrary. Fully geometrically nonlinear Total Lagrangian formulation is used. Geometric integration is performed over a regular background grid that does not conform to the simulation geometry. Explicit time integration is used via the central difference method. As an example the simple but fully nonlinear Neo-Hookean material model is employed. The results are compared with a finite element simulation to verify the usefulness of the method. Copyright © 2010 John Wiley \& Sons, Ltd.},

Several partitioning schemes are considered and a reduced graph-based procedure is presented. Partitioning issues are discussed and procedures to accommodate essential boundary conditions in parallel are presented.

abstract="When a solid element experience large deformations, the components of stress will, in general, vary as a result of material rotation. These changes occur even in the absence of additional strain, and need to be accounted for in formulating constitutive laws that involve the rate of change of stress. In this paper the correction terms are extended to the case when material axes become strongly skewed. An expression for the rate of material rotation as an explicit function of vorticity, rate of deformation and stretch is derived. It is then shown that the rate of change of stress depends on the rate of material rotation. As an example, expressions for material rotation and stress are derived for a hypoelastic material undergoing uniform, rectilinear, shear. The shear stress is compared with a solution that neglects skewing of the axes, and it is found that, for the example, skewing may be neglected for strains less than 0.4. Finally, the use of these relations in numerical calculations involving finite deformation is discussed.",

To represent the non-linear effects, an elastic part depending on the elastic equivalent strain and a non-Newtonian viscous part depending on both viscous equivalent strain rate and cumulated viscous strain are tested. The model parameters can then be accurately obtained through a comparison with the experimental uniaxial and biaxial tests. The influence of the temperature on the viscous part is also modelled and an evaluation of the adiabatic self heating of the specimen is compared to experimental results."

Caractérisation multi-axiale du comportement et de la microstructure d’un semi-cristallin: application au cas du PET. Thèse de doctorat de l’ENS de Cachan]. Using an accurate equivalent deformation, a non-Newtonian viscous model coupled with induced crystallisation seems to give a good representation of strain hardening for different kinds of solicitations. Moreover, a WLF-like parameter is identified and allows to be a representative of the range of the process temperatures with a single test at 90°C. As temperature is a crucial parameter for both process and mechanical tests, we focus on the study of the influence of the temperature regulation on the dispersion of mechanical results. We use here a probabilistic approach giving convincing results and leading to a direct industrial application: knowing the heating regulation default of the process, one can predict the variation of the mechanical behaviour of the perform during blow moulding and therefore the variability of final product properties like thickness or crystallinity ratio."

abstract="The injection stretch blow moulding process involves the inflation and stretching of a hot preform into a mould to form bottles. A critical process variable and an essential input for process simulations is the rate of pressure increase within the preform during forming, which is regulated by an air flow restrictor valve. The paper describes a set of experiments for measuring the air flow rate within an industrial ISBM machine and the subsequent modelling of it with the FEA package ABAQUS. Two rigid containers were inserted into a Sidel SBO1 blow moulding machine and subjected to different supply pressures and air flow restrictor settings. The pressure and air temperature were recorded for each experiment enabling the mass flow rate of air to be determined along with an important machine characteristic known as the `dead volume'. The experimental setup was simulated within the commercial FEA package ABAQUS/Explicit using a combination of structural, fluid and fluid link elements that idealize the air flowing through an orifice behaving as an ideal gas under isothermal conditions. Results between experiment and simulation are compared and show a good correlation.",

abstract = {Abstract The orientation characteristics of extruded poly(ethylene terephthalate) (homopolymer) sheets are discussed with respect to: mode of extension (simultaneous versus sequential), strain rate, stretch ratio, and temperature. The nature of the stress–strain curve recorded during the process of extension, and its dependence on the parameters of extension mentioned above, are analyzed. Results show that for specimens stretched in the biaxial simultaneous mode, the stress–strain curve is concave upward, which is typical for amorphous polymeric materials. Strain-hardening occurs at high planar extensions, and is accompanied by a steep rise in the stress measured during stretching. The magnitude of this stress increases with increasing strain rate and extension ratios, but decreases with increasing temperature of stretching. During biaxial sequential extension, the stress–strain curve is concave upward at low strain rates or at high temperatures of stretching, but becomes convex upward at higher strain rates or lower temperatures. The curve also changes from concave to convex upward at high limiting extension ratios in the first direction. The convex upward nature of the stress-strain curve is typical of semi-crystalline materials, indicating the occurrence of strain-induced crystallization during stretching in the first direction. Again, the level of stress, measured during stretching, increases with increasing strain rate and limiting extension ratio in the first direction, while it decreases with increasing temperature of stretching. © 1993 John Wiley \& Sons, Inc.},

The aim was to generate a data set more comprehensive than previously available, to support the development of an improved constitutive model for PET, suitable for process modelling. Isotropic, almost-amorphous films were prepared by extrusion from two grades of PET, with differing molecular weight. The ranges of strain-rate and temperature encompassed were 0.2–16 s−1 and 81–116 °C. Constant width (CW) and equal-biaxial (EB) straining was employed. The material response varied dramatically across the range, from glass-like with post-yield strain-softening at the highest rates and lowest temperatures, to elasto-viscous fluid-like flow at the lowest rates and highest temperatures. Effects of differing molecular weight were seen at the highest temperatures, with the higher molecular weight polymer showing more pronounced strain-stiffening. The results were interrogated so as to identify and quantify agreement and disagreement with the constitutive model proposed previously (Adams AM, Buckley CP. Polymer 2000; 42: 771–786), thereby informing revision of the model."

abstract = "In this paper we propose a fast algorithm for bivariate interpolation of large scattered data sets. It is based on the partition of unity method for constructing a global interpolant by blending radial basis functions as local approximants and using locally supported weight functions. The partition of unity algorithm is efficiently implemented and optimized by connecting the method with an effective cell-based searching procedure. More precisely, we construct a cell structure, which partitions the domain and strictly depends on the dimension of the subdomains, thus providing a meaningful improvement in the searching process compared to the nearest neighbour searching techniques presented in Allasia et al. (2011) and Cavoretto and De Rossi (2010, 2012). In fact, this efficient algorithm and, in particular, the new searching procedure enable us a fast computation also in several applications, where the amount of data to be interpolated is often very large, up to many thousands or even millions of points. Analysis of computational complexity shows the high efficiency of the proposed interpolation algorithm. This is also supported by numerical experiments."

Sample applications are presented including a simulation of the necking of a uniaxial tension specimen, a static analysis of an O-ring seal, and a cylindrical bar impacting a rigid wall. NIKE2D is a fully vectorized, implicit, finite-deformation, large-strain, finite-element code for analyzing the response of two-dimensional axisymmetric and plane-strain solids. A variety of loading conditions can be handled including traction boundary conditions, displacement boundary conditions, concentrated nodal point laods, body force loads due to base accelerations, and body-force loads due to spinning. Slide-lines with interface friction are available. Elastic, orthotropic-elastic-plastic, thermo-elastic-plactic, soil and crushable foam, linear viscoelastic, thermo-orthotropic elastic, and elastic-creep materials models are implemented. Nearly incompressible behavior that arises in plasticity problems and elasticity problems with Poisson's ratio approaching 0.5 is accounted for in the element formulation to preclude mesh lock-ups and associated anomalous stress states. Four-node isoparametric elements are used for the spatial discretization, and profile (bandwidth) minimization is optional.},

This Lagrangian finite element program uses an explicit time integration operator to integrate the equations of motion. Four node uniform strain quadrilateral elements are used in the finite element formulation. A number of new numerical algorithms which have been developed for the code are described in this report. An adaptive time step control algorithm is described which greatly improves stability as well as performance in plasticity problems. A robust hourglass control scheme which eliminates hourglass distortions without disturbing the finite element solution is included. All constitutive models in PRONTO are cast in an unrotated configuration defined using the rotation determined from the polar decomposition of the deformation gradient. An accurate incremental algorithm was developed to determine this rotation and is described in detail. A robust contact algorithm was developed which allows for the impact and interaction of deforming contact surfaces of quite general geometry. A number of numerical examples are presented to demonstrate the utility of these algorithms. 41 refs., 51 figs., 5 tabs.},

The von Neumann stability analysis shows that the discrete equations of both Lagrangian and semi-Lagrangian discretizations are stable when they are integrated using stabilized conforming nodal integration. On the other hand, integrating the semi-Lagrangian discretization with a direct nodal integration yields an unstable discrete system which resembles the tensile instability in SPH. Under the framework of semi-Lagrangian discretization, it is shown that the inclusion of convective term yields a more stable discrete system compared to the semi-Lagrangian discretization without convective term as was the case in SPH.",

Invoking an affine deformation assumption, the evolution of the network — consisting of a large number of molecular chains per unit volume, which are initially randomly oriented in space — is shown to be governed by a balance equation in orientation space. Eulerian and Lagrangian type formulations of these balance equations are given, and the closed-form analytical solution for the so-called Chain Orientation Distribution Function is derived. This full network model is then used to describe the large strain inelastic behaviour of rubber-like materials. Detailed comparisons with experimental results and with two approximate models, namely the classical three-chain model and a very recently proposed eight-chain model, are provided for different types of deformation and rubbers. Finally, the network model is applied to describe the orientational hardening in amorphous glassy polymers, and confronted with experimental data for polycarbonate. The inherent physical limitations of the network theory for both applications are discussed."

The OTM method enforces mass transport and essential boundary conditions exactly and is free from tension instabilities. The OTM method exactly conserves linear and angular momentum and its convergence characteristics are verified in standard benchmark problems. We illustrate the range and scope of the method by means of two examples of application: the bouncing of a gas-filled balloon off a rigid wall; and the classical Taylor-anvil benchmark test extended to the hypervelocity range.

abstract = "Aconstitutive model is proposed for the deformation of rubber materials which is shown to represent successfully the response of these materials in uniaxial extension, biaxial extension, uniaxial compression, plane strain compression and pure shear. The developed constitutive relation is based on an eight chain representation of the underlying macromolecular network structure of the rubber and the non-Gaussian behavior of the individual chains in the proposed network. The eight chain model accurately captures the cooperative nature of network deformation while requiring only two material parameters, an initial modulus and a limiting chain extensibility. Since these two parameters are mechanistically linked to the physics of molecular chain orientation involved in the deformation of rubber, the proposed model represents a simple and accurate constitutive model of rubber deformation. The chain extension in this network model reduces to a function of the root-mean-square of the principal applied stretches as a result of effectively sampling eight orientations of principal stretch space. The results of the proposed eight chain model as well as those of several prominent models are compared with experimental data of Treloar (1944, Trans. Faraday Soc. 40, 59) illustrating the superiority, simplicity and predictive ability of the proposed model. Additionally, a new set of experiments which captures the state of deformation dependence of rubber is described and conducted on three rubber materials. The eight chain model is found to model and predict accurately the behavior of the three tested materials further confirming its superiority and effectiveness over earlier models."

abstract="This paper is the first investigation establishing the link between the meshfree state-based peridynamics method and other meshfree methods, in particular with the moving least squares reproducing kernel particle method (RKPM). It is concluded that the discretization of state-based peridynamics leads directly to an approximation of the derivatives that can be obtained from RKPM. However, state-based peridynamics obtains the same result at a significantly lower computational cost which motivates its use in large-scale computations. In light of the findings of this study, an update to the method is proposed such that the limitations regarding application of boundary conditions and the use of non-uniform grids are corrected by using the reproducing kernel approximation.",

abstract="Many modern applications of the flexible multibody systems require formulations that can effectively solve problems that include large displacements and deformations having the ability to model nonlinear materials. One method that allows dealing with such systems is continuum-based absolute nodal coordinate formulation (ANCF). The objective of this study is to formulate an efficient method of modeling nonlinear nearly incompressible materials with polynomial Mooney--Rivlin models and volumetric energy penalty function in the framework of the ANCF. The main part of this paper is dedicated to the examination of several ANCF fully parameterized beam elements under incompressible regime. Moreover, two volumetric suppression methods, originating in the finite element analysis, are proposed: a well-known selective reduced integration and F-bar projection. It is also presented that the use of these methods is crucial for performing reliable analysis of models with bending-dominated loads when lower-order elements are employed. The results of the simulations carried on with considered elements and proposed methods are compared with the results obtained from commercial finite element package and existing ANCF implementation. The results show important improvement as compared with previous applications and good agreement with reference results.",

Film specimens were drawn at constant width at temperatures 75–120°C and strain-rates 1–16 s−1, using a specially developed testing machine—the Flexible Biaxial Film Tester. The stress-strain data obtained, together with similar results from uniaxial tests, allowed a recently-proposed three-dimensional constitutive model for amorphous polymers to be tested and applied to PET. It was found that the yield, flow and strain-stiffening observed in drawing could be described well by the model at the lower temperatures. A procedure was devised for systematically fitting data to the model, and produced values of the model parameters which were interpreted in terms of the physical mechanisms of flow and rubber-like strain stiffening. The major inadequacy of the model was that it did not include flow resulting from entanglement slippage, modified in PET by stress-induced crystallization, that intervenes at the upper end of the temperature range."

abstract = {Abstract A physically based, isostructural, constitutive model is described for simulating the onset of nonlinear viscoelasticity in multiaxial creep of glassy polymers, as needed in stress analyses of load-bearing components. In the linear viscoelastic limit, shear response reduces to that of a generalized Maxwell model, while hydrostatic response is Hookean. Nonlinearity enters through Eyring-type rate process kinetics. The equations of the model are solved numerically using a pseudo-linear approximation through each time step, leading to an incremental equation for stress that would be convenient for use in finite element analyses. The model and its assumptions were tested using tension, shear and combined tension/shear creep experiments on well-aged poly(methyl methacrylate) at 70°C. Reproducibility tests confirmed the assumption of constant glass structure for strains up to ∼ 1.5 × 10−2. Shear and pressure activation volumes were obtained by fitting the dependence of the shear compliance on stress invariants. The data showed unequivocally that shear activation volumes vary with log(relaxation time), and excellent agreement was obtained for a linear variation, consistent with the “compensation rule” of polymer thermo-viscoelasticity. The activation volumes are large (many monome units), indicating the cooperative nature of the elementary flow process. Interestingly, they are of the same order as those applying to yield and plastic flow. Although the model finds success in simulating creep, it fails to describe so accurately the strain recovery on unloading. Possible explanations are suggested.},

abstract = {Because most approximation functions employed in meshfree methods are rational functions with overlapping supports, sufficiently accurate domain integration becomes costly, whereas insufficient accuracy in the domain integration leads to suboptimal convergence. In this paper, we show that it is possible to achieve optimal convergence by enforcing variational consistency between the domain integration and the test functions, and optimal convergence can be achieved with much less computational cost than using higher-order quadrature rules. In fact, stabilized conforming nodal integration is variationally consistent, whereas Gauss integration and nodal integration are not. In this work the consistency conditions for arbitrary order exactness in the Galerkin approximation are set forth explicitly. The test functions are then constructed to be variationally consistent with the integration scheme up to a desired order. Attempts are also made to correct methods that are variationally inconsistent via modification of test functions, and several variationally consistent methods are derived under a unified framework. It is demonstrated that the solution errors of PDEs due to quadrature inaccuracy can be significantly reduced when the variationally inconsistent methods are corrected with the proposed method, and consequently the optimal convergence rate can be either partially or fully restored.

The strain at the evaluation points is approximated by corrected (smoothed) nodal derivatives which are determined by a discrete form of the divergence theorem between nodal shape functions and their derivatives in Taylor’s expansion. We prove that such smoothed nodal derivatives also meet the differentiation of the approximation consistency (DAC). The same Taylor’s expansion is applied to the weak form and the smoothed nodal derivatives are used to compute the stiffness matrix. The proposed QC1 scheme can pass both the linear and the quadratic patch tests exactly in a numerical sense. Several examples are provided to demonstrate its better numerical performance in terms of convergence, accuracy, efficiency and stability over other one-point integration methods in the meshfree literature, especially its superiority over the existing linearly consistent one-point (LC1) quadratures."

abstract = {We present a one-parameter family of approximation schemes, which we refer to as local maximum-entropy approximation schemes, that bridges continuously two important limits: Delaunay triangulation and maximum-entropy (max-ent) statistical inference. Local max-ent approximation schemes represent a compromise—in the sense of Pareto optimality—between the competing objectives of unbiased statistical inference from the nodal data and the definition of local shape functions of least width. Local max-ent approximation schemes are entirely defined by the node set and the domain of analysis, and the shape functions are positive, interpolate affine functions exactly, and have a weak Kronecker-delta property at the boundary. Local max-ent approximation may be regarded as a regularization, or thermalization, of Delaunay triangulation which effectively resolves the degenerate cases resulting from the lack or uniqueness of the triangulation. Local max-ent approximation schemes can be taken as a convenient basis for the numerical solution of PDEs in the style of meshfree Galerkin methods. In test cases characterized by smooth solutions we find that the accuracy of local max-ent approximation schemes is vastly superior to that of finite elements.

Three types of instabilities were identified in one dimension: an instability due to rank deficiency, a tensile instability and a material instability which is also found in continua. The stability of particle methods with Eulerian and Lagrangian kernels is markedly different: Lagrangian kernels do not exhibit the tensile instability. In both kernels, the instability due to rank deficiency can be suppressed by stress points. In two dimensions the stabilizing effect of stress points is dependent on their locations. It was found that the best approach to stable particle discretizations is to use Lagrangian kernels with stress points. The stability of the least-squares stabilization was also studied.

abstract = {Smooth particle hydrodynamics (SPH) is a robust and conceptually simple method which suffers from unsatisfactory performance due to lack of consistency. The kernel function can be corrected to enforce the consistency conditions and improve the accuracy. For simplicity in this paper the SPH method with the corrected kernel is referred to as corrected smooth particle hydrodynamics (CSPH). The numerical solutions of CSPH can be further improved by introducing an integration correction which also enables the method to pass patch tests. It is also shown that the nodal integration of this corrected SPH method suffers from spurious singular modes. This spatial instability results from under integration of the weak form, and it is treated by a least-squares stabilization procedure which is discussed in detail in Section 4. The effects of the stabilization and improvement in the accuracy are illustrated via examples. Further, the application of CSPH method to metal-forming simulations is discussed by formulating the governing equation associated with the process. Finally, the numerical examples showing the effectiveness of the method in simulating metal-forming problems are presented. Copyright © 2000 John Wiley \& Sons, Ltd.},

In this study, the procedure of constructing moving least square interpolation function is facilitated by using the notion of reproducing kernel formulation, which, as a generalization of the early discrete approach, establishes a continuous basis for a partition of unity. This new formulation possesses the quality of simplicity, and it is easy to implement. Moreover, the reproducing kernel formula proposed is not only able to reproduce any mth order polynomial exactly on an irregular particle distribution, but also serves as a projection operator that can approximate any smooth function globally with an optimal accuracy. In this contribution, a generic m-consistency relation has been found, which is the essential property of the MLSRK approximation. An interpolation error estimate is given to assess the convergence rate of the approximation. It is shown that for sufficiently smooth function the interpolant expansion in terms of sampled values will converge to the original function in the Sobolev norms. As a meshless method, the convergence rate is measured by a new control variable—dilation parameter ρ of the window function, instead of the mesh size h as usually done in the finite element analysis. To illustrate the procedure, convergence has been shown for the numerical solution of the second-order elliptic differential equations in a Galerkin procedure invoked with this interpolant. In the numerical example, a two point boundary problem is solved by using the method, and an optimal convergence rate is observed with respect to various norms."

Problems are encountered with the original MPM when material points cross between grid cells, and this has been tackled by the development of the Generalised Interpolation MPM, where material points’ domains of influence extend beyond the currently occupied grid cell. In this paper, the Generalised Interpolation Material Point (GIMP) Method has been implemented implicitly in a manner that allows a global stiffness matrix to be constructed similar to that in the Finite Element Method (FEM) by combining contributions from individual elements on the background grid. An updated Lagrangian finite deformation framework has been used to ensure non-linear behaviour within each of the loadsteps. The weighting functions used for this which make the GIMP method different to standard MPM are presented and the implementation is explained. Specific details on computing the deformation gradient to be consistent with the updated Lagrangian framework and the updating of the material point influence domains are outlined, both of which are currently unclear in the published literature. It is then shown through numerical examples that for both small and large deformation elastic and elasto-plastic problems, the implicit GIMP method agrees well with analytical solutions and exhibits convergence properties between that of linear and quadratic FEM."

The improved version is specifically designed for severe, finite deformation and offers significantly enhanced stability as opposed to the original formulation. This is achieved by (i) formulating the quasistatic mechanical boundary value problem in a suitable updated-Lagrangian setting, (ii) introducing anisotropy in the shape function support to accommodate directional variations in nodal spacing with increasing deformation and eliminate tensile instability, (iii) spatially bounding and evolving shape function support to restrict the domain of influence and increase efficiency, (iv) truncating shape functions at interfaces in order to stably represent multi-component systems like composites or polycrystals. The new scheme is applied to benchmark problems of severe elastic and elastoplastic deformation that demonstrate its performance both in terms of accuracy (as compared to exact solutions and, where applicable, finite element simulations) and efficiency. Importantly, the presented formulation overcomes the classical tensile instability found in most meshfree interpolation schemes, as shown for stable simulations of, e.g., the inhomogeneous extension of a hyperelastic block up to 100% or the torsion of a hyperelastic cube by 200° — both in an updated Lagrangian setting and without the need for remeshing."

abstract = {Abstract A new algorithm is developed to improve the accuracy and efficiency of the material point method for problems involving extremely large tensile deformations and rotations. In the proposed procedure, particle domains are convected with the material motion more accurately than in the generalized interpolation material point method. This feature is crucial to eliminate instability in extension, which is a common shortcoming of most particle methods. Also, a novel alternative set of grid basis functions is proposed for efficiently calculating nodal force and consistent mass integrals on the grid. Specifically, by taking advantage of initially parallelogram-shaped particle domains, and treating the deformation gradient as constant over the particle domain, the convected particle domain is a reshaped parallelogram in the deformed configuration. Accordingly, an alternative grid basis function over the particle domain is constructed by a standard 4-node finite element interpolation on the parallelogram. Effectiveness of the proposed modifications is demonstrated using several large deformation solid mechanics problems. Copyright © 2011 John Wiley \& Sons, Ltd.},

We show that taking the variation of a principle leads to a set of differential equations, known as Euler equations, and boundary conditions. Thus, the first variation of a variational principle is equivalent to a weak form of the Euler equations. Numerical solutions to a variational theorem may be achieved by direct approximation of the dependent variables involved. For linear differential equations we show when it is possible to deduce an equivalent variational principle from the weak form. The chapter also summarizes the treatment of constraints by a Lagrange multiplier method, as well as by penalty, perturbed Lagrangian and augmented approaches. This chapter includes a toolbox of methods that are useful in later treatment of problems where two or more subdomains are joined together or where constraints such as near incompressibility of elastic bodies or transverse shear constraints in plates are encountered."

Conservation is an essential property in simulations where large localized mass, momentum or energy transfer occurs such as high-velocity impact or explosion modeling.

In order to provide for the boundary fluxes one must identify the boundary particles. A new, purely geometric boundary detection technique for assemblies of spherical particles is described.

A stability analysis reveals a reduction in the critical time step by a factor of 1/√2 when the stress points are located at the extremes of the SPH particle. An elementary damage law is also introduced into the 1-D formulation. Application to a 1-D impact problem indicates far less oscillation in the pressure at the interface for coarse meshes than with the standard SPH formulation.

We demonstrate that the (now) conventional procedures for error analysis used in the finite element method require careful application in the EFGM, otherwise competing sources of error work against each other. Examples are provided of previous works in which adopting an FEM-based approach leads to dubious refinements. The discretisation error is here split into contributions arising from an inadequate number of degrees of freedom eh, and from an inadequate basis ep. Numerical studies given in this paper show that for the EFGM the error cannot be easily split into these component parts. Furthermore, we note that arbitrarily setting the size of nodal supports (as is commonly proposed in many papers) causes severe difficulties in terms of error control and solution accuracy. While no solutions to this problem are presented in this paper it is important to highlight these difficulties in applying an approach to errors from the FEM in the EFGM. While numerical tests are performed only for the EFGM, the conclusions are applicable to other meshless methods based on the concept of nodal support."

abstract = "The previously developed reproducing kernel particle method (RKPM) employs a high-order quadrature rule for desired domain integration accuracy. This leads to an over-constrained condition in the limit of incompressibility, and volumetric locking and pressure oscillation were encountered. The employment of a large support size in the reproducing kernel shape function increases the dependency in the discrete constraint equations at quadrature points and thereby relieves locking. However, this approach consumes high CPU and it cannot effectively resolve pressure oscillation difficulty. In this paper, a pressure projection method is introduced by locally projecting the pressure onto a lower-order space to reduce the number of independent discrete constraint equations. This approach relieves the over-constrained condition and thus eliminates volumetric locking and pressure oscillation without the expense of employing large support size in RKPM. The method is developed in a general framework of nearly incompressible finite elasticity and therefore linear problems are also applicable. To further reduce the computational cost, a stabilized reduced integration method based on an assumed strain approach on the gradient matrix associated with the deformation gradient is also introduced. The resulting stiffness matrix and force vector of RKPM are obtained explicitly without numerical integration."

The method is based on a variational approach, and the central idea is that the variational principle selects both the discretized physical fields and the discretization parameters, here those defining the support size of each basis function. We consider local maximum-entropy approximation schemes, which exhibit smooth basis functions with respect to both space and the discretization parameters (the node location and the locality parameters). We illustrate by the Poisson, linear and non-linear elasticity problems the effectivity of the method, which produces very accurate solutions with very coarse discretizations and finds unexpected patterns of the support size of the shape functions.
